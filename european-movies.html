          The Hunt (Danish: Jagten) is a 2012 Danish psychological drama film
          directed by Thomas Vinterberg and starring Mads Mikkelsen. It is set
          in a small Danish village around Christmas, and follows a man who
          becomes the target of mass hysteria after being wrongly accused of
          sexually abusing a child in his kindergarten class. The movie is one
          of the best psychological european movies you can choose to watch and
          even after finishing watching this movie it still makes you think
          about it, it makes you think what a little lie can do to the life of
          someone. In my opinion it is one of best movies that Mads Mikkelsen
          have ever been in.
