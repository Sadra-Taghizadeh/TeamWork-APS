        The film industry is a constant flow of changing numbers and releases
        that we, as film lovers, have to keep an eye on. Although the audience
        might not be as interested in the grossing numbers as the franchises
        themselves, it’s always mind-blowing to see just how many people around
        the globe pay for the same cinema ticket as you do. More than that, box
        office numbers indicate to studios which movies do well and which don't,
        influencing executive decisions about future projects they might invest
        in.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the release of Spider-man: No Way Home, which overtook Avatar at
        the domestic box office, and this year's premiere of The Batman starring
        Robert Pattinson, the statistics for highest-grossing franchise will
        probably keep changing. Take a look at the 10 highest-grossing movie
        franchises of all time as of July 2022.

      <p>
        There's been heavy discourse about the upcoming Amazon Prime TV series
        based on J.R.Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books called Lord of the Rings:
        The Rings Of Power. The disappointment appears to be universal: from the
        costumes, to dwarves without beards and to them getting many details
        wrong. It probably won't gain too much of an audience like the original
        trilogy had managed. We're talking about a trilogy that was directed by
        Peter Jackson and had all three films shot simultaneously, starring big
        names such as Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, and Orlando
        Bloom. Jackson has definitely set the bars high for fantasy franchises,
        given trilogy has grossed over $5.8B.

      <h2 id="link9"><sup>9th </sup>X-Men — $6.07B</h2>

        alt="X Men photo"
      />
      <p>
        Stan Lee and Jack Kirby are back at it again with rightfully taking
        credit for creating the X-Men mutants and allowing it to become the
        eighth highest-grossing movie franchise of all time with $6.06B. Since
        the Marvel Studios obtained rights to the X-Men franchise, it was only a
        matter of time until the worlds would merge together on screen. With the
        recent release of Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, we can
        certainly confirm that the X-Men will appear in the MCU franchise.
        Although there have already been some fandom disputes, we're excited to
        see how this works out.

      <h2 id="link8"><sup>8th </sup>Fast and Furious — $6.6B+</h2>

        alt="fast & furious photo"
      />
      <p>
        Looking back at the Fast and Furious franchise, it could get a little
        ridiculous and unrealistic — and yet, you can't help but completely love
        everything about it. The franchise has grossed over $6.6B throughout 20
        years so far. We still have two more movies to look forward to, which
        will conclude the series. The franchise perfectly mixes the sense of
        family with danger and illegal wrongdoings. We can also thank it for
        thrusting Vin Diesel and Paul Walker to stardom.

      <h2 id="link7"><sup>7th </sup>Batman — $6.8B</h2>

        alt="a batman photo"
      />
      <p>
        With the release of The Batman starring Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz
        earlier this year, the Batman franchise has moved up a few spots. The DC
        Comics hero has been adapted more than 13 times over the span of 82
        years, and the craze probably won't die down anytime soon. Indeed, $6.8
        billion is more than enough to confirm that the fandom wants to see more
        of Gotham City's Caped Crusader.

      <h2 id="link6"><sup>6th </sup>The Avengers — $7.76B</h2>

        alt="a phot of The Avengers"
      />
      <p>
        We all know just how massive the MCU is, but you still have to admit
        that four films alone grossing over $7.76B is more than impressive. Has
        anyone ever watched the Avengers quadrilogy independently of the other
        movies? Does it still make sense? Sometimes it feels nostalgic to think
        about what it was like back in 2012 when everyone had their floor in the
        Avenger's Tower. But we have to accept that the chapter is already
        closed — for now. With new MCU heroes joining the fray, new Avengers
        team-ups and formations are bound to happen.

      <h2 id="link5"><sup>5th </sup>James Bond — $7.88B</h2>

        alt="bond cover photo"
      />
      <p>
        Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton,
        Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig have all portrayed the agent 007 by the
        name of James Bond from 1962 to 2021. This equals to 27 movies that have
        grossed over $7.88B worldwide. Despite some criticisms of the
        franchise's narrative elements, it's no secret that Bond is the most
        renowned spy character in the history of cinema. The amount of
        speculation that has gone into the search for the next James Bond is a
        testament to the franchise's longevity.

      <h2 id="link4"><sup>4th </sup>Harry Potter — $9.20B</h2>
      <img

        alt="Harry potter photo"
      />
      <p>
        The success of the Harry Potter book series was a big indicator of how
        the films would do when Warner Bros. decided to develop them. Ten movies
        have managed to gross over $9.20B in the worldwide box office. All four
        directors that worked on the movies (Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón,
        Mike Newell, and David Yates) put their unique spin on the style and the
        storytelling. The Fantastic Beasts is a great spin-off prequel, but we
        would also definitely love to see a series dedicated to the Marauders'
        era at Hogwarts.

      <h2 id="link3"><sup>3rd </sup>Spider-Man — $9.25B+</h2>
      <img

        alt="a photo of Spider-Man"
      />
      <p>
        It's only recently that the Spider-Man franchise took Harry Potter's
        third place as the highest grossing franchise. It's all thanks to the
        release of the latest Spider-Man: No Way Home movie, which has grossed
        over $1.53 billion worldwide. Although Kevin Feige confirmed that they
        are developing a fourth MCU Spider-Man movie, it's hard to say how it's
        going to work out given the ongoing conflict between Disney and Sony. No
        matter the drama and disputes, Spider-Man still ranks third with over
        $9.25B grossed.

      <h2 id="link2"><sup>2nd </sup>Star Wars — $10.31B+</h2>
      <img

        alt="an star-wars photo"
      />
      <p>
        Nine movies grossing over $10.31B and all nominated for the Academy
        Awards at some point — this is as clear an indication of both critical
        and commercial success as can be. We wonder if it was George Lucas'
        intention to make a pop-cultural phenomenon out of a sci-fi movie,
        something never seen before the 70s. With 3 separate film trilogies and
        another planned trilogy on the way, it's safe to say that Star Wars will
        more than likely keep its spot on this list.
      </p>

      <h2 id="link1"><sup>1st </sup>Marvel Cinematic Universe — $26.6B+</h2>

        src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1UXsoOz5btDA2IOYomvDh0PeCHKASZkYE"
        alt="MCU photo"
      />
      <p>
        At last, we have a franchise that is so far ahead with the box office
        numbers, that it's nearly impossible to take its place. It certainly
        helps there are over two dozen movies in the franchise so far, but it
        doesn't mean each of those movies aren't indeed commercial successes.
        From Iron Man in 2008 to, most recently, Doctor Strange in the
        Multiverse of Madness in May 2022, the Marvel Cinematic Universe keeps
        proving there are more stories to tell. Even though some are afraid the
        universe is getting too complicated and nonsensical, the $26.6 billion
        mark is a sign they won't stop anytime soon.
